# F2L Trainer

This is a simple F2L Trainer based on [JPerm's F2L algortihms sheet](https://bit.ly/bestf2l) and can be thought of as an unofficial extension to [JPerm's CFOP trainer](https://jperm.net/).

## ðŸš§ Work in progress

This project is still a work in progress. This is because I am not sure if someone finds this tool helpful. If the project happens to receive positive feedback, I will be more than happy to continue with the development.
